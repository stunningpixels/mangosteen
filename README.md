# Mangosteen

### What is it?

A PHP framework to kickstart any project. Mangosteen provides an easy way to get your ideas down and write code efficiently.

Each release of Mangosteen is compatible with the last and so you can keep your apps secure and up to date without the hastle of rewriting all your code. All the Mangostein core assets are stored in a completely separate folder from your service specific assets so you can update easily.

### Who is it for?

Any developer looking to build a dynamic PHP driven service, whether it be a website or an API. It's aimed at medium sized sites that serve dynamic database driven content.

Some of Mangosteen's features include:

* Separate routing, database and front-end processes and reuse code
* Barebones admin panel for blog-style changes to pages and routing visualisation
* Dynamic and static URI routing for various applications
* Easy updating of the Mangosteen core
* Built in security module for user accounts

### What libraries are included?

These ship with mangosteen and are required for it to function:

* Smarty (Front end templating)
* MeekroDB (MYSQL interaction)
* SPYC (YAML parser)

### Development

This is WIP, I don't develop it full time but I use it in most of my web applications. Whenever I find i'm using a piece of code or a function multiple times I always consider adding it to Mangosteen.

If you find a bug please raise an issue!
